The solution contains 2 parts:
1. BotBackend - It's the web hook for Telegram bots and also the server side for monitor website 
2. BotStatusFrontend - It's the client side for monitor website that displays status monitor on the 3 bots

Comments:
* I didn't treat the whole subject of 'users' who engaged the bot and who disengage - I understand from Dev Task document that it is not neccessary for the exam.


Run and Test Instructions
1. BotBackend
	* It's implemented as a nodejs server, execute the following command to run the server: 
		'node server.js'
3. BotStatusFrontend 
	* It's implemented as an Angular 8 project, to run it in development environment execute the following command:
		'ng serve'
	* Open Chrome browser and navigate to 'localhost:4200', you should see the main page.

Summary
1. It was a very interesting and instructive project. thanks!
2. I tested the entire solution in my computer and all was run and work perfectly, so I hope you succeed in running everything in your environment as well.
